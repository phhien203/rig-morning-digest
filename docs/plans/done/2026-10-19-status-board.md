# Status board

One page with the lane's state, readable in under a minute.

## 1. Status model

`src/status.ts`: adapter + install time from `rig.json`, last beat, nights on disk (newest
first).

Done when: unit-tested against a temp dir.

## 2. Board view

`GET /` with the layout: the lane banner (lane id + marker) on every page, then the status
table and the nights list. Missing beat renders as a warning, not an empty cell.

Done when: route test checks the banner and the nights.

## 3. Preview for review

Save `/` as one HTML file and send the reviewer the link.

Done when: the reviewer has reviewed it.
